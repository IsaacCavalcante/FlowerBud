# FlowerBud

- This project is a experiment of CoreML use. I follow the section 24 classes of App Brewary iOS course: https://www.udemy.com/course/ios-13-app-development-bootcamp/
- This projet use CoreML to classify a flower photo and search from Wikipedia API a brief text about recognized flower
- This is the original model used https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=13v58uJqi_pAXKoBa2J7mZ7sLkaSRVUBb named oxford102.coffemodel
- Oxford102.coffemodel was parsed by CoreML model using coremltools (https://pypi.org/project/coremltools/)
- I made just a small modification using MLKitTranslate to translate from english to portuguse wekepidia texts
